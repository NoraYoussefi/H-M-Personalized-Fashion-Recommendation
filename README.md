## K-Means Intution
- K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm (clustering).
- K-means works by grouping some data points together (clustering) in an unsupervised fashion.
- The algorithm groups observations with similar attribute values together by measuring the Euclidian distance between points.
## K Means Algorithm Steps
- Choose number of clusters “K”
- Select random K points that are going to be the centroids for each cluster
- Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, doing so will enable us to create “K” number of clusters
- Calculate a new centroid for each cluster
- Reassign each data point to the new closest centroid
- Go to step 4 and repeat.
